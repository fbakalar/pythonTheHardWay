    the <and> keyword is used if all conditions in a 
     boolean expression must be met
     ex:
         if age < 55 and sex == 'M':...

not:
    the <not> keyword negates a boolean value
     test a boolean condition
     ex:
        if grade not in grades:...

or:
    the <or> keyword is used if at least one condition 
     must be met

is:  
    tests for object identity / are they identical?
        eg - whether we are talking about the same object
        note: multiple variables may refer to same object
            [] is [] ?  False  - because they are 2 distinct objects
            
    == operator tests for equality
            [] == [] ?  True - because they are equivalent
               even though they are not the same object
